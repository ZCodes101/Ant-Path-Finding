# Ant-Path-Finding
Method to find the best path using Ant Colony Optimization algorithm 

## Runtime Compexity notes
The runtime complexity of the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm depends on the number of iterations (MAX_ITERATIONS), the number of ants (NUM_ANTS), and the number of nodes in the graph (numNodes). In this implementation:

Each iteration involves generating paths for all ants and updating pheromones, leading to a complexity of O(MAX_ITERATIONS * NUM_ANTS * numNodes^2).
Generating a path for a single ant involves selecting the next node, which has a complexity of O(numNodes).
Updating pheromones involves iterating over all paths of ants, leading to a complexity of O(NUM_ANTS * numNodes^2).
Overall, the runtime complexity of the algorithm is often considered to be moderate and can be adjusted based on the problem size and desired accuracy.

### Why use ACO 
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. In nature, ants collectively find the shortest path between their nest and a food source by laying down and following pheromone trails. ACO mimics this behavior by using artificial ants to explore the solution space, gradually increasing the concentration of pheromones on better solutions and biasing subsequent exploration towards those paths.

ACO is important due to its ability to efficiently find near-optimal solutions to complex combinatorial optimization problems. Unlike traditional optimization algorithms, ACO does not require explicit mathematical formulations or derivatives of the objective function. Instead, it relies on the emergent behavior of a population of artificial agents (ants) to iteratively converge towards good solutions. This makes ACO particularly well-suited for problems where traditional optimization techniques may struggle, such as routing, scheduling, and vehicle routing problems.

One of the key advantages of ACO is its versatility and adaptability to various problem domains. It has been successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including network routing, job scheduling, vehicle routing, protein folding, and telecommunications network design, among others. ACO's ability to handle complex, dynamic, and large-scale optimization problems makes it an attractive choice for researchers and practitioners seeking efficient and effective solutions in diverse fields.

In summary, ACO offers a powerful and flexible approach to solving combinatorial optimization problems by drawing inspiration from the collective intelligence of ant colonies. Its ability to find high-quality solutions across a wide range of domains has cemented its importance in the field of optimization and computational intelligence, making it a valuable tool for addressing complex real-world challenges.


### Here are a few reasons why the best path may vary between runs:

Random Initialization: The algorithm initializes the ants' paths randomly at the start of each iteration. This randomness affects the exploration process, leading to different paths being explored in each run.

Random Decision Making: The algorithm uses probabilistic decision-making when ants choose the next node to visit. Even if the pheromone levels and heuristic information remain constant, the random selection process can result in different paths being chosen.

Pheromone Evaporation: The algorithm incorporates pheromone evaporation, which reduces pheromone levels over time. This process introduces variability, as the amount of pheromone on each edge may vary between runs.

Convergence to Local Optima: ACO is not immune to converging to local optima, especially in complex problem spaces. Different runs may lead to different local optima depending on the exploration paths taken.

Due to these factors, the best path found by the ACO algorithm may vary between runs. However, the algorithm is designed to converge towards good solutions over multiple iterations, and the variability between runs is often mitigated by averaging or running the algorithm multiple times to ensure robustness and reliability in the obtained solutions.
